# Guessing_Game

### Game Logic
1. Create a randomly generated number from 1-100
2. Player inputs their guess in a text field
    * input field value = ''
    * the function will grab the user input value
3. Button that is clickable 'onclick' or 'addEventListener'
    * when button is clicked...user input is registered
    * does user input = randomly generated number?
4. If player guesses random number they win!
    * condition...if guess wrong then try again
5. Hint after each guess
6. 5 unsuccessful guesses = game over and player loses
